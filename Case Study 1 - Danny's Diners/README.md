#### Answer:

| Customer | Total Points | 
| -------- | ------------ |
|     A    |      860     |
|     B    |      890     |
|     C    |      590     |

- Total points for Customer A is 860.
- Total points for Customer B is 890.
- Total points for Customer C is 590.

### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

````sql

WITH dates AS 
(
    SELECT *, date('2023-01-31') AS Last_Date
    FROM members 
),

    cte AS
(
    SELECT d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, sa.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price,
    SUM(CASE
          WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
          WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND sa.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
          ELSE 10 * m.price
          END) AS points

    FROM dates AS d
    INNER JOIN sales AS s
       ON d.customer_id = s.customer_id
    INNER JOIN sales_adjusted sa
        ON s.customer_id = sa.customer_id
    JOIN menu AS m
       ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    WHERE s.order_date < d.last_date
    GROUP BY d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, sa.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price
)

SELECT customer_id AS Customer, SUM(points) AS "Total Points"
FROM cte
WHERE Customer IN('A', 'B')
GROUP BY Customer;

````

**Assumptions Made:**
- On Day -X to Day 1 (customer becomes member on Day 1 ```join_date```) : Each customer's $1 spent is equal to 10 points while for sushi its 20 points.
- On Day 1 ```join_date``` to Day 7 ```valid_date```, each $1 spent for all items is 20 points.
- On Day 8 to ```last_day``` of Jan 2023, each $1 spent is 10 points and sushi is 20 points.

#### Answer:

| Customer | Total Points | 
| -------- | ------------ |
|     A    |     6660     |
|     B    |     6510     |

- Total points for Customer A is 6660.
- Total points for Customer B is 6510.

### Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql

WITH summary AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id AS Customer, s.order_date AS Order_Date, m.product_name AS Product, m.price AS Price,

      WHEN me.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
      ELSE 'N' END AS Member
   FROM sales AS s
   LEFT JOIN menu AS m
      ON s.product_id = m.product_id
   LEFT JOIN members AS me
      ON s.customer_id = me.customer_id
)

SELECT *, CASE
   WHEN member = 'N' then NULL
   ELSE
      RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY Customer, Member
      ORDER BY Order_Date) END AS Ranking
